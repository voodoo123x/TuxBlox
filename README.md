# TuxBlox
TuxBlox is an open source Tuxcoin full node graphical wallet for Windows running on .NET Framework. The goal is to provide a vibrant and intuitive UI on top of the full node wallet.

Currently there are no prebuilt binaries. I plan to have an alpha release in the near future. If you would like to test, clone the repository and open in Visual Studio (development has been done in Visual Studio 2017). You will also need to **install MvvmLightLibs** via Nuget to the Tuxblox project.

## tuxcoind
The provided binaries for tuxcoind.exe are version 0.17.2 released on September 21, 2018. Feel free to either run tuxcoind from another directory prior to opening TuxBlox or drop your own binaries into Tuxblox\Daemon directory.

## Warning: TuxBlox is still in alpha and under development!
#### This software is still in alpha stage and as such, may not yet be stable which could result in the loss of funds. Please be cautious and use at your own risk.
